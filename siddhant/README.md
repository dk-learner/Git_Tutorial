# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects in Python

Welcome to this repository containing two Python-based machine learning scripts. These files demonstrate basic ML workflows including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📁 Files Included

- `model_training.py`:  
  This script loads a dataset, preprocesses it, trains a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, or similar), and evaluates its performance.

- `model_prediction.py`:  
  This script loads a pre-trained model and performs predictions on new input data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run these scripts locally, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dk-learner/Git_Tutorial.git
cd Git_Tutorial
